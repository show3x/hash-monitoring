# hash-monitoring

**A program to monitor the change in the hash of the selected file.**

Hello everyone, this is our first project on github. I decided to write a program that will monitor the files you choose to change the hash, if the hash changes, it will send a notification to the computer itself, and you can also add a tg bot https://t.me/notifymsghash_bot which will also send you notifications in case of a hash change. This program will help you to detect unwanted changes in any files of your choice, that's extremely useful in case if you have any concerns about your machine has been infected by any malicious software which can change content of important files such as system files, saved passwords, etc. Many thanks to the frontend developer. And also in this bot you can get a picture of Statham.

The program will be finalized.
