# hash-monitoring

Hello everyone, this is my first project on github. I decided to write a program that will monitor the files you choose for hash changes, if the hash changes, then it will send a notification to the computer itself, and you can also add a tg bot https://t.me/notifymsghash_bot that will also send you notifications in case of a hash change. And also in this bot you can get a picture of Statham.

A program to monitor the change in the hash of the selected file.
The program is poorly optimized at the moment.
The program will be finalized.
